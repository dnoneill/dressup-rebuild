## Biography
I am the Lead for Emerging Literacies Librarian at UCLA Powell Library. My interests and background is in digital humanities and scholarship, emerging literacies, archives and special collections, outreach and instruction, and design and typography. My professional experience includes working in museums, archives, and academic libraries, including the LA Museum of the Holocaust, USC Shoah Foundation, and USC Libraries. As a former Association of Research Libraries Diversity Fellow and ALA Spectrum Scholar, I am passionate about increasing diversity in the field, and am always happy to talk to new and fellow colleagues in the field. I am also actively involved in professional organizations and am the co-chair of the UCLA Information Studies Diversity Council.
