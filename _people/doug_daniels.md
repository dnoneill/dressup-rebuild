## Biography
Prior to graduating from UCLA in 2014, I worked for several years in the film industry, primarily as an assistant editor at a trailer house that worked on campaigns for movies like Casino Royal and Spiderman 3. I also spent some time working on set as a PA and a boom operator. After my stint in the film industry, I went back to school and transferred to UCLA from Glendale Community College. I graduated with a major in History and a minor in German. During my time at UCLA, I worked for CLICC, eventually working my way up to being a Helpdesk Specialist, which led me to my current position.
